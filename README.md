## About me
I am Nykenik24, and i **LOVE** programming.

The single feeling of solving a problem coding is something perfect for me
## My projects
I am not working in any project at this moment
## My goals
### Learn some game developing
- Learn the ``Love2d`` Framework, a lua framework to make 2D games, i really like it and know some Lua
- Learn some art and music design
### Learn some more langs.
I know Lua and some Python, but i think i need to learn *more*, learn languages with more complex syntax and features
### Be in a Game Jam
I think just participating is enough, i *love* the idea of making a little game in some time limit to let my creativity
flow, but i need to learn the basics first!
